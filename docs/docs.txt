Hostel Mess Management System (C++)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Hostel Mess Management System developed in C++.
It is a semester project for the course Fundamentals of Programming with C++ at University of Gujrat.

The main purpose of this project is to manage hostel mess records in a simple and efficient way.
It helps to store student data, update meals, calculate mess bills, and save records in a file.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

To understand basic concepts of C++

To practice arrays, functions, loops, and conditions

To learn file handling (reading and writing files)

To create a menu-driven program

To build logical thinking for real-life problems

🛠️ Features of the System
